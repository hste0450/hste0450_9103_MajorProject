# Major Project IDEA9103
## *Modern Wheel of Fortune* 

#### Introduction

This repository hosts the development files for the "Modern Wheel of Fortune," an individual continuation of our Major Project group assignment. Our group was inspired by Pacita Abad's colorful and vibrant piece, ["Wheels of Fortune"](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pacita-abad-wheels-of-fortune). In an effort to bridge the classic with the contemporary, we opted to digitally reinterpret one of the wheels from Abad's artwork, infusing it with a modern twist through the use of dynamic lighting and visual effects. 

#### Project overview
"Modern Wheel of Fortune" explores how traditional artworks can be transformed into digital experiences. My specific contribution uses a combination of *Perlin Noise* and *randomness* to animate the artwork, introducing motion and life that echo the vibrcy of Abad's original work.

#### Technical Description

- **Perlin Noise**: Employs natural, fluid transformations in visual elements
- **Randomness**: Adds unpredictability to the animation, reflecting the spontaneity found in the original artwork


#### Animation Features
- **Colour transitions**: Smooth transitions across a predefined palette using noise functions, enhancing visual appeal
- **Rotating Movements**:  Elements such as flowers and chains rotate dynamically, driven by noise and randomness, simulating continual evolution
- **Blinking Diamonds**: The geometric diamonds in the artwork change in size, simulating a blinking effect. This randomness introduces a playful and lively element to the artwork, drawing the viewerâ€™s attention to different areas of the canvas and enhancing the overall complexity.
- **Dynamic Glowing Circles**: Circles in the artwork dynamically bounce in size using Perlin noise, simulating a pulsating effect that adds depth and vibrancy.



#### Individual approach

Unlike other group members who have concentrated their efforts on *user interaction*, *audio*, and *time-based* animations, my contribution uniquely leverages *Perlin Noise* and *randomness* to introduce distinct visual dynamics into the project. Here are the specific aspects that set my work apart:

- **Rotational Dynamics**: I've implemented noise-driven rotations that affect both the individual elements and the overall artwork, creating a natural and continuous movement that mimics the unpredictability of nature, contrasting with the deliberate time-based rotations and mouse-driven interactions developed by my peers.

- **Blinking Diamonds**: My approach includes dynamic changes in the visibility and size of geometric shapes, specifically diamonds, which "blink" intermittently using randomness. 

- **Colour Variability**: While others have used audio cues to shift colours, I have utilized randomness and noise to continuously shift the colours of elements in an unpredictable manner. This not only adds visual interest but also reinforces the theme of spontaneocity and constant change.

- **Radiating Lines with Noise-Driven Movement**: Instead of using static animations or sound-responsive behaviors, the radiating lines in this project subtly shift their angles based on Perlin Noise. This modification allows the lines to pivot dynamically around their central point, creating a natural and fluid motion that enhances the organic feel of the artwork. 

- **Flower design**: Unlike the single-layered flower, my flower design incorporates multiple layers and varying opacities to simulate depth and realism. This layered approach enhances the flower's texture and volume, making it appear more lifelike and dynamic.

Each of these elements was chosen not only for their aesthetic contributions but also to ensure that my animations provide a unique interpretative layer to our group's reimagining of Pacita Abad's 'Wheels of Fortune.' These techniques underscore my focus on creating an experience that evolves unpredictably, mirroring the essence of the original artwork's vibrancy and movement.
