# Major Project IDEA9103
## *Modern Wheel of Fortune* 

#### Introduction

This repository hosts the development files for the "Modern Wheel of Fortune," an individual continuation of our Major Project group assignment. Our group was inspired by Pacita Abad's colorful and vibrant piece, ["Wheels of Fortune"](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pacita-abad-wheels-of-fortune). In an effort to bridge the classic with the contemporary, we opted to digitally reinterpret one of the wheels from Abad's artwork, infusing it with a modern twist through the use of dynamic lighting and visual effects. 

#### Project overview
The "Modern Wheel of Fortune" is an exploration of how traditional artworks can be transformed into digital experiences. This project specifically focuses on utilizing generative art techniques to simulate the vibrant, dynamic essence of Abad's work. My contribution centers on animating the artwork using a combination of *Perlin Noise* and *randomness* to introduce motion and life into the digital reinterpretation.

#### Technical Description

- **Perlin Noise**: Used to create a more natural, fluid transformation in the visual elements of the artwork. 
- **Randomness**: Injects an element of unpredictability in the animation, reflecting the spontaneity of the original artwork's theme and composition


#### Animation Features
- **Colour transitions**: Colours are interpolated using noise functions to smoothly transiiton across a predefined palette, enhancing the visual appeal and maintaining a lively, engaging aesthetic. 
- **Rotating Movements**: Elements within the artwork, such as digitally recreated flowers and chains, rotate dynamically. These rotations are driven by a combination of noise functions and randomness, emulating the feeling of a constantly evolving piece of art.
